Hex Rules
Hex is played on a rhombic grid of hexagons, typically of size 11Ã—11, although other sizes are also possible.
Each player has an allocated color, conventionally red and blue, or black and white. Each player is also
assigned two opposite board edges. The hexagons on each of the four corners belong to both adjacent board edges.

The players take turns placing a stone of their color on a single cell on the board. The most common convention
is for Red to go first. Once placed, stones are not moved, replaced, or removed from the board. Each player's
goal is to form a connected path of their own stones linking their two board edges. The player who complete
such a connection wins the game.
